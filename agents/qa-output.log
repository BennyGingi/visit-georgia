Phase 1: Running Bug Finder (Agent 1)
========================================

QA Bug Finder completed. Here's the final summary:

```
🔍 QA Bug Finder - Completed
Total Issues Found: 48
- Critical: 6
- High: 11
- Medium: 18
- Low: 13

Report: /BUGS.md
Next: Run Agent 2 (Auto Fixer) to fix issues
```

**Key findings by category:**

**CRITICAL (6):** Empty HE/RU destination data breaks entire `/destinations/[slug]` for 2/3 languages, hardcoded English on CTA buttons and labels on destinations page, EmailJS has placeholder credentials making email booking non-functional.

**HIGH (11):** Russian tour names show English due to `isRTL` logic bug, raw `<img>` tags used everywhere instead of Next.js `<Image>` (12+ locations), multiple hardcoded English section headers, FloatingWhatsApp and BookingForm error messages in English only, PricingTable routes not translated, tour modal close button missing aria-label, tour cards not keyboard accessible.

**MEDIUM (18):** Form labels not associated with inputs, HTML `lang` attribute not updated on language change, ~30+ SVGs missing `aria-hidden`, low-opacity text contrast issues, mobile menu lacks focus trapping, duplicated code patterns (language hook, WhatsApp SVG, pricing data, animation variants), copyright year outdated (2025).

**LOW (13):** Unused imports (AnimatePresence, Image, Link x2), dead code (fadeIn variant, 3 Logo components, CURRENCY_NAMES), modals missing `role="dialog"`, minor responsive issues.

**Passed checks:** TypeScript compilation, production build, all links/routes valid, all destination slugs match, proper heading hierarchy, all images have alt text, no TODO comments, no stray console.logs.
